/**
 * This class inherits all the default behaviors (methods) from Animal.
 *
 * The author recognized that Dog objects should bark, so the author chose
 * to override the speak() method. Certainly this solves the problem.
 *
 * However, the author of this class chose to send the "bark" message
 * to the console. Is this always what we want? What if someone else wants
 * to reuse the Dog class, but in a GUI based program?
 *
 * Furthermore the author of Dog forgot to copy the "bark" message into the
 * spokenMessage property by calling setSpokenMessage(). As result, the state of
 * the spokenMessage is inconsistent with the actual message spoken. If another
 * programmer references the dog object and calls getSpokenMessage(), the
 * result will be "[mute]". Ooooops!
