provides one method that all subclasses can use. Only problem is, the method
is poorly written.

    This method expects a String value as a parameter (message). Just to be
    safe, it checks to make sure the incoming argument is a String with a
    length greater than 0. Good idea! But the author forgot to check for
    message == null. As a result, if message is null, the if statement will
    error out with a NullPointerException.
     
    Why? We tried to call a method isBlank() that belongs to a String
    object stored in the message variable. But if message is null, we have
    no object. The message variable contains a pointer to null, or nothing!
    That's why we get NullPointerException.
     
    One more thing, do we always want the message displayed in a JOptionPane?
    Here we have little choice.
